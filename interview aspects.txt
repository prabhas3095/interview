Test Plan: E-commerce Application Load and Billing Testing

Introduction

Purpose: The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the stability,
 performance, and accuracy of the E-commerce application under load and to verify the billing functionality.
System Under Test (SUT): E-commerce application
Test Environment: Production-like environment

Objectives

Validate the application's performance and stability under high load conditions.
Verify the correctness of the billing functionality.
Identify and report any defects or issues found during testing.
Ensure 100% bug-free application usage for ordering products.

Scope

Test Levels: Performance testing, Functional testing
Test Types: Load testing, Stress testing, Endurance testing, Functional testing
Test Deliverables: Test plan, Test scenarios, Test scripts, Test reports

Test Strategy

Performance Testing: Conduct load and stress testing to evaluate system performance under expected and peak load conditions.
Functional Testing: Validate the functionality of the application, with a focus on the billing process.

Test Scenarios

a) Performance Testing Scenarios:

Scenario 1: Simulate 1000 concurrent users browsing products.
Scenario 2: Simulate 1000 concurrent users adding products to the cart.
Scenario 3: Simulate 1000 concurrent users performing the checkout process.

b) Functional Testing Scenarios:

Scenario 1: Verify product search functionality.
Scenario 2: Validate adding products to the cart.
Scenario 3: Test various payment methods for billing accuracy.
Scenario 4: Validate order confirmation and tracking functionality.

Resource Allocation

Testing Team: Allocate a dedicated testing team with expertise in performance and functional testing.
Test Environment: Ensure a production-like environment with realistic data and server configurations.
Test Tools: Utilize appropriate tools for load testing, performance monitoring, and defect tracking.

Timelines

Test Preparation: 1 week
Test Execution: 2 weeks
Defect Reporting and Tracking: Ongoing throughout the testing phase
Test Completion: 3 weeks

Risks and Constraints

Limited time for testing due to project constraints.

Coordinating with other teams for test environment setup and data preparation.
Potential impact on live transactions during load testing.

Exit Criteria

All test scenarios executed and passed successfully.
Defects reported, tracked, and resolved.
Performance metrics meet or exceed defined thresholds.
Completion of test documentation and reports.

Reporting

Regular status updates and test execution progress reports.
Detailed defect reports with proper prioritization and severity levels.
Final test report summarizing the testing activities, results, and recommendations.
